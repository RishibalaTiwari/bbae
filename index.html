        Every moment with you feels like a fairytale come true.  
        You are the first thought in my mind when I wake up and the last one when I fall asleep. ❤️  
        You make my heart race, my smile brighter, and my days so much better.  
        I can't wait to spend today (and every day) making memories with you! 😘💖

        You’re the most incredible person I’ve ever met, and I’m so lucky to be yours.  
        Forever thankful for the love you give me every single day. 🌹
        Miss you Baby... muaahhh
